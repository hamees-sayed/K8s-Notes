Kubernetes is a system that manages containers (containerized applications) where a container could be explained as a lightweight virtual machine. To build an application you need to build a bunch of containers and then use Kubernetes to manage those containers. This sounds like something very difficult and time-consuming, but the advantage is that **Kubernetes can create and scale containers automatically and manage storage among all the containers.**
